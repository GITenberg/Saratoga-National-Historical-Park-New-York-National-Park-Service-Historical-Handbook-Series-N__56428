<p class="tb">Few battles in world history have had a more stirring climax than
Saratoga and probably none have had more far-reaching consequences.
Here, a ragged but inspired rebel army convincingly demonstrated
its ability to rise to brilliant victory after absorbing staggering
blows. In dramatic fashion Saratoga not only rescued the colonists from
almost certain defeat, but also pointed significantly to the fate which
likely would befall any enemy force penetrating into the interior of
America and operating independently of the sea.</p>
<p>Abroad, the battles served immeasurably to increase the military
prestige of American arms, while at home they greatly strengthened the
fighting morale and discouraged loyalist opposition. In their broad
aspects the two battles of Saratoga may be considered to mark definitely
the turning point of the American Revolution in that the result brought
to the cause of the hard-pressed colonists the assistance of France, Spain,
and Holland, thereby greatly increasing the probability of eventually
winning independence. To a hesitant, vacillating France awaiting the
opportune moment to strike a telling blow at the British, Saratoga
brought the decision for intervention&mdash;a decision which previous diplomatic
negotiations had been unable to obtain. The active entrance of
France into the war in June 1778, provided the financial, military, and
naval support without which the American cause would have been
practically hopeless. Though three more years of fighting were necessary
in order to bring ultimate victory at Yorktown, Saratoga furnished the
physical and psychological impetus which brightened a desperate cause
at a moment when failure would have been disastrous. Without the
success of American arms at Saratoga, it is difficult to see how the
struggle could long have been continued.</p>
<p>Writing of the significance of Saratoga, Sir Edward Creasy, the eminent
English historian, said: &ldquo;Nor can any military event be said to have exercised
more important influence upon the future fortunes of mankind,
than the complete defeat of Burgoyne&rsquo;s expedition in 1777; a defeat
which rescued the revolted colonists from certain subjection; and which,
by inducing the Courts of France and Spain to attack England in their
behalf, insured the independence of the United States, and the formation

<p>A contemporary of the event said of it, &ldquo;Rebellion which a twelve-month
ago was a contemptible pygmy, is now in appearance a giant.&rdquo;
Saratoga truly must be considered as one of the cornerstones of American
liberty and as one of those momentous events which shape the destiny
of nations. Even in the light of the nearly two centuries that have elapsed,
the significance of this epochal victory is difficult to appraise fully.</p>
<h2 id="c1"><span class="small"><i>The British Plan of 1777</i></span></h2>
<p>The Hudson River-Lake Champlain route for centuries has constituted
a great strategic highway of the continent. Long the warpath of
the powerful Iroquois, this route in pre-Revolutionary years had witnessed
the ebb and flow of the tides of invasion as England and France
locked in a titanic struggle for possession of the New World. Along
this route the British commander, General Abercrombie, advanced in
1758 on his ill-fated attempt to seize Ticonderoga from the French.
The graves of the &ldquo;Black Watch&rdquo; attest the blunders of his judgment.
One year later his successor, Lord Amherst, followed the same route,
to succeed where his predecessor had failed.</p>
<p>With the outbreak of the Revolutionary War the area again became
the scene of active fighting, as colonial arms pushed boldly northward
to seize Ticonderoga, Crown Point, and Montreal, and to storm the
ramparts of Quebec. In 1776, the British launched a counterattack which,
after wiping out most of the American gains, was dramatically checked
by the gallant action of the American fleet under Gen. Benedict Arnold
on Lake Champlain.</p>

</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_4">4</div>
<p>It was no idle chance that Britain, after 2 years of futile effort to coerce
the colonies, should choose the Hudson-Champlain Valley as the route
offering the greatest strategic possibilities for a quick suppression of the
rebellion. Obviously, from a military standpoint, once control could be
obtained of the ports and the narrow strip of coastal plain along the
Atlantic seaboard, the backbone of the rebellion would be broken. By
virtue of her seapower, England already had possession of the chief ports.
Thus she was able to turn her attention to the second phase of her
strategy. Of the 3 million American colonists, approximately three-fourths
lived in the narrow border strip from Massachusetts to the
northern boundary of Virginia. The key to this populous area was the
Hudson-Champlain line. The dominance of this natural avenue of transportation
would not only provide an effective barrier separating the
New England States from the rest of the struggling colonists, but would
remove any menace to the rear of the British armies operating offensively
to the south. In control of this area Britain could then crush the separate
armies in detail.</p>
<p>The British plan was conceived by Gen. John Burgoyne and approved
by the King and Cabinet. It called for a double advance along
the Hudson in which the army of Burgoyne moving southward from
Canada would effect a junction at Albany with the army of Sir William
Howe moving northward from New York City, the two to be
joined by Gen. Barry St. Leger moving eastward along the Mohawk
from Oswego on Lake Ontario. That this strategy would succeed appeared
certain, for against an American army composed chiefly of raw
recruits&mdash;ill-disciplined and poorly equipped&mdash;were matched the seasoned
veterans of the British forces, led by the foremost military commanders
of the time.</p>
<h2 id="c2"><span class="small"><i>The Burgoyne Campaign</i></span></h2>
<p>With all the pomp and pageantry characteristic of the 18th century,
Burgoyne embarked from St. Johns, Canada, on June 17, 1777, with a
force of approximately 9,400 men. He was directed &ldquo;to proceed with
all expedition to Albany and put himself under the command of Sir
William Howe.&rdquo; The army consisted of about 4,700 British regulars,
4,200 German troops hired by the King of England, and between 600
and 700 Canadians, Tories, and Indians. It was accompanied by a splendid
train of artillery made up of 138 bronze cannon. Seldom, if ever, has the
American continent witnessed a more picturesque display of military
splendor. To the gay, multicolored uniforms of the various British,
German, Canadian, and Tory regiments were added the bright war paint
and feathers of their Indian allies.</p>

</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_6">6</div>
<p>With 3 large vessels, 20 gunboats, and 200 flat-bottomed transports,
Burgoyne sailed boldly along the 200-mile length of Lake Champlain to
attack his first objective, Fort Ticonderoga, the American guardian of
northern New York and New England. On July 1, the British Army
reached Fort Ticonderoga and began the siege of this fortress, which was
considered by British and Americans alike to be the strongest in North
America. A number of factors, unknown to the British and most
Americans, however, had caused the strength of Ticonderoga to be
greatly overestimated. The lines of the fort had been laid out to be held
by an army of at least 10,000 men; the American commander, Gen.
Arthur St. Clair had only some 3,000 men on hand with which to defend
these vast works. Due to the shortage of men, and perhaps also to
neglect, the Americans had failed to fortify steep Sugar Hill (Mount
Defiance) which dominated the fort from the southwest. It was the
belief of the American leader that the slopes of this mountain were so
steep that they would prevent the British from dragging cannon to its
top. Burgoyne&rsquo;s engineers soon dispelled this American illusion, for on
the afternoon of July 5 the Americans were horrified to see the Royal
Army constructing batteries on the mountaintop. Once these cannon
were in position, the American Army was in immediate danger of being
completely encircled.</p>
<h2 id="c3"><span class="small"><i>Retreat of the Americans</i></span></h2>
<p>General St. Clair at once made plans to abandon the fortress. That
night, under cover of darkness, the American Army began retreating
across the bridge of boats which ran from the fort to the east shore of
Lake Champlain. Here the American Army split&mdash;half of it retreated
by land and the other half, with the sick, wounded, and supplies, embarked
on the small American fleet and sailed down South Bay to Skenesboro
(Whitehall). As the secret retreat was being successfully carried
out, one of the buildings in the fort caught fire, and the flames revealed
to the British on the summit of Mount Defiance the events that were
taking place below.</p>
<p>Burgoyne ordered an instant pursuit. With great speed and energy,
the British general, accompanied by the English fleet and part of his
army, smashed through the floating bridge, which the Americans had
hoped would retard the British pursuit, and sailed swiftly down South
Bay after the retreating American fleet. At the same time Burgoyne dispatched
Gen. Simon Fraser, with the remaining part of the Royal
Army, in pursuit of the American forces retreating by land. On the afternoon
of July 6, Burgoyne, with his fleet, overtook the Americans
as they neared Skenesboro and proceeded to capture and destroy all that
remained of the American fleet, taking many prisoners and supplies,
while the remnants of the American Army fled into the forest.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_7">7</div>
<p>Early on the morning of July 7, General Fraser launched an attack,
near Hubbardton, Vt., on the rear guard of the section of the American
Army that was retreating by land. After a fierce battle the American
force was totally routed and dispersed over the mountains. Near Fort
Ann, on July 8, the British also defeated a third force of American
troops. Everywhere, then, the American armies were in full retreat
before the advance of Burgoyne&rsquo;s triumphant army. Also there now
swarmed ahead of the Royal Army great numbers of savage Indian
warriors, terrorizing the settlers of the Hudson Valley.</p>

</div>
<p>By taking Fort Ticonderoga, Burgoyne had opened the gateway to the
Hudson, destroyed the American fleet on Lake Champlain, captured
great quantities of supplies, and taken many prisoners as well as 128
American cannon; all at a loss of less than 200 men. George III was so
<span class="pb" id="Page_8">8</span>
exultant over the news from Ticonderoga that he is said to have exclaimed:
&ldquo;I have beat them! I have beat all the Americans!&rdquo; The fall of
this fortress proved a severe shock to the American morale and served
further to increase British contempt for the character of colonial
resistance.</p>
<p>Although the roads far to the south were jammed with long lines of
wagons, horses, and men of the retreating American Army and with the
families of frightened settlers as they fled before the invading army,
Gen. Philip Schuyler, the American commander of the Northern Department,
had not yet given up the struggle. He concentrated the
remnants of the fleeing American forces at Fort Edward, and from there
he dispatched hundreds of axmen to fell trees, blocking the roads to the
north. Bridges were destroyed, crops burned, and cattle and horses
driven off along the route of the British advance. Marching 23 miles
overland from Skenesboro through Fort Ann to Fort Edward on the
Hudson, Burgoyne encountered innumerable delays because of the
rough nature of the country and the effective retarding tactics adopted
by General Schuyler. It was not until July 30 that the Royal Army
was finally able to reach Fort Edward, 23 days after the battle of Hubbardton.
This was an average advance of only 1 mile a day.</p>
<p>On his arrival at Fort Edward the British commander found himself
confronted with a new problem. His Indian allies had driven off friend
and foe alike, and, in territory where Burgoyne had expected to receive
aid and support, he found only abandoned homes and fields. With an
army of some 8,500 men, 39 remaining bronze cannon, 1,700 baggage
and artillery horses, and 200 head of oxen to supply, and faced with a
countryside devastated by his Indians and his foe, the British commander
found it necessary to bring practically all of his provisions from Canada.
This operation required the utmost efforts of his army, and it was mid-September
before Burgoyne could bring forward sufficient supplies to
enable him to cross the Hudson at Saratoga.</p>
<h2 id="c4"><span class="small"><i>The St. Leger Expedition</i></span></h2>
<p>By this time the tide of events already had started running against the
British. This was first evidenced by the news of St. Leger&rsquo;s defeat at the
bloody battle of Oriskany on August 6. St. Leger&rsquo;s force of about 1,600
men was made up chiefly of Tories, under the leadership of Sir John
Johnston and Col. John Butler, and a number of Indians of the Iroquois
Confederacy. The Iroquois were divided in their sympathies, but Joseph
Brant and his Mohawk warriors and many Cayugas and Senecas joined
St. Leger. The immediate objective of St. Leger was to reduce Fort
Stanwix, which was held by 500 men under Col. Peter Gansevoort. As
the British leader approached the fort, German settlers of the Mohawk
Valley assembled under the leadership of Gen. Nicholas Herkimer and
<span class="pb" id="Page_9">9</span>
advanced to its relief. The Tories and Indians prepared an ambuscade in
a ravine near Oriskany, 6 miles below Fort Stanwix, where Herkimer
and his farmer militia were almost entirely surrounded. In a desperate
struggle with knife, hatchet, bayonet, and clubbed rifle, Herkimer and
his men finally put the Indians and Tories to flight from a field that has
few, if any, equals in savage horror on the American continent. Herkimer,
himself, died from the effects of a wound received on the field of carnage,
and his followers were so reduced and exhausted by the ordeal that they
were compelled to return to their homes. Sixteen days later St. Leger&rsquo;s
force was dispersed by the defection and desertion of his Indian allies on
receipt of news in his camp that a large force under Benedict Arnold,
dispatched by General Schuyler, was approaching for the relief of Fort
Stanwix. Only a few of St. Leger&rsquo;s troops ever found their way back to
Montreal.</p>

<div class="pb" id="Page_10">10</div>
<h2 id="c5"><span class="small"><i>The Battle of Bennington</i></span></h2>
<p>Another crushing calamity was in store for the British. Schuyler&rsquo;s policy
of destroying all the crops along the line of Burgoyne&rsquo;s march had important
consequences. It was well known that most of the inhabitants
of upper New York, along the Champlain-Hudson route, were favorable
to the British cause. Burgoyne had counted on these Tories to
aid him materially, especially in the matter of supplies. Now, with the
maturing crops systematically destroyed before him, he was faced with
difficulty in providing for his army. This led him to send an expedition
of about 800 men, under Col. Friedrich Baum, to Bennington, Vt., to
capture a large store of supplies which had been gathered there for the
American forces. Gen. John Stark aroused the countryside, and the
Vermont farmers turned out and on August 16 administered a crushing
defeat to Baum&rsquo;s troops. Another contingent, under Lt. Col. Heinrich
Breymann, came up at this time and threatened to undo Stark&rsquo;s
victory, but the timely arrival of Col. Seth Warner and his Green Mountain
Rangers overwhelmed Breymann, and the German commander was
forced to retreat. By this blow Burgoyne lost approximately 800 men,
mostly Germans, and 4 bronze cannon, which seriously weakened his
army at a critical time and prevented him from obtaining much needed
supplies. The electrifying news of this American victory, after a long
series of defeats, not only discouraged Burgoyne&rsquo;s Indian allies, but also
greatly encouraged militia enlistments in the Patriot army.</p>
<p>Of still greater concern to Burgoyne, however, was the fact that no
word had been received from Howe concerning his cooperation from
the south. As a matter of fact, Howe had chosen to move southward and
attack Philadelphia, even though he knew Burgoyne expected to receive
his cooperation. Despite these setbacks to the British, which had greatly
boosted American morale, Burgoyne, in compliance with his orders,
gambling on the belated cooperation of Howe and on his own ability to
smash the American force in his front, crossed the Hudson River at
Saratoga on September 13. Thus he severed his communications with
Canada and risked all on a push to Albany.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig10">

</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_11">11</div>
<h2 id="c6"><span class="small"><i>The American Line</i></span></h2>
<p>The two recent American victories greatly stimulated the hopes and
efforts of the colonists. Men and supplies began to pour into Schuyler&rsquo;s
tiny army which had now retreated as far south as Halfmoon. On
August 19, just 3 days after the victory at Bennington, Maj. Gen.
Horatio Gates replaced General Schuyler as the commander of the
Northern Department. As the American Army increased in confidence
and strength, growing from a low point of some 3,000 men, it began
advancing slowly up the Hudson. Four miles from Stillwater, the British
advance came upon the Americans, 9,000 strong, firmly entrenched
at Bemis Heights under the command of Gates.</p>
<p>The American position was well chosen, for here the bluffs so converged
with the river as to produce a narrow opening along the river
plain through which a passage could be made only at great hazard. With
a deep entrenchment blocking the river road, Thaddeus Kosciuszko, the
Polish engineer and general who had volunteered in the American cause,
had lost no time in establishing a strong line of defense which in appearance
was like the segment of a great circle. Powerful batteries extended
along the edge of the bluff. From there the line turned northwestward
and followed the natural advantages of the ground to a
commanding knoll near the site of the Neilson barn where it then
turned south by west, terminating at the edge of a ravine approximately
three-quarters of a mile distant. The extremities of this position were
defended by strong batteries. Most of the line was strengthened by a
breastwork, without entrenchments, constructed from the trunks of
felled trees, logs, and rails.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig11">
<img src="images/p08a.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="434" />
<p class="pcap"><i>View looking east from the American river batteries, the key to

and thus blocked Burgoyne&rsquo;s advance.</i></p>
</div>
<p>At the apex of the line, Neilson&rsquo;s barn was converted into a rude fort,
and a strong battery was established at this point. Running in front of
the right wing of the American position, in a parallel direction, was a
<span class="pb" id="Page_12">12</span>
deep, heavily wooded ravine. The area immediately in front and to the
west of the center of the American line, however, had been partially
cleared, so that the felled trees made an abatis difficult to penetrate.
Except for a small number of scattered farm clearings, the rough and
rolling ground to the north of the American position was so thickly
wooded as to furnish a distinct handicap to a coordinated attack or to
the proper use of artillery.</p>
<h2 id="c7"><span class="small"><i>Composition of the American Army</i></span></h2>
<p>Behind the right wing of the American position were stationed the Continental
brigades of Nixon, Paterson, and Glover under the immediate
command of Gates. Behind the center and left were the Continental
brigades of Poor and Learned; also the 500 Virginia riflemen and 300
Light Infantry of Major Dearborn, which together composed a corps led
by Col. Daniel Morgan. Morgan&rsquo;s riflemen had been specially assigned
by General Washington to the force confronting Burgoyne, as they were
well versed in backwoods fighting and were calculated to offset the
Indian and Tory allies of the British. The troops led by Poor, Learned,
and Morgan constituted a division under the command of Arnold. Present
with the American Army was an artillery train of 22 cannon. Thus
stationed, and continuing to improve their fortifications, the American
troops awaited the advance of Burgoyne.</p>
<h2 id="c8"><span class="small"><i>The Battle of September 19</i></span></h2>
<p>It was at this point in the campaign that Burgoyne felt most severely
the loss of his Indian allies. After his attempt to discipline the Indians
for their brutal murder of Jane McCrea at Fort Edward on July 27, and
the two British reverses at Oriskany and Bennington, the Indian nations
rapidly began to abandon the royal cause. Up to this time the
front and flanks of Burgoyne&rsquo;s army had been covered with an almost
impenetrable cloak of savage warriors who had closely harassed the retreating
American Army, attacking small detachments and bringing
Burgoyne valuable information on American movements. With the
loss of his Indian warriors, however, the situation was reversed. Burgoyne
was deprived of military intelligence; and, hovering about the
Royal Army were hundreds of American scouts who attacked small
British units and counted in detail the numbers of men, tents, wagons,
and boats in Burgoyne&rsquo;s army.</p>
<p>Thus, on September 19, Burgoyne had little accurate information on
the strength or disposition of the American Army that blocked his way
to Albany. A heavy fog covered both the American and British camps
<span class="pb" id="Page_13">13</span>
that morning. While the Royal Army waited for the heavy mists to lift,
they prepared to advance in three parallel columns, as they had previously
done since crossing the river at Saratoga. Burgoyne&rsquo;s objective that
day was to move his army safely forward through the heavy forests to a
position near enough to the hidden American camp to enable him to
begin effective operations against the American lines.</p>

</div>
<p>Accordingly, on the morning of September 19, Burgoyne moved forward
in three columns from his encampment in the vicinity of the Sword
House. The right column under Fraser, numbering 2,830 men composed
of British and German grenadiers and light infantry, together with the
British 24th regiment and the irregulars, advanced along the road running
westward from the Sword House to a point 3 miles distant where
it then turned south. The center column, consisting of the British 9th,
20th, 21st, and 62nd regiments, was led by Burgoyne. This force, which
numbered approximately 1,840 men, followed the route of Fraser for
a short distance and then turned southeast at the first fork which led
to the Great Ravine. Crossing the ravine, the column then turned westward
in an effort to take a position parallel in line with Fraser&rsquo;s column.
The left column of about 3,160 men under General Riedesel, consisting
of six companies of the British 47th regiment and the German regiments
of Riedesel, Rhetz, Specht, and Hesse Hanau, was to advance along the
<span class="pb" id="Page_15">15</span>
river road accompanied by the heavy artillery, the baggage train, and
bateaux. They were to await the signal gun which would indicate that
the right and center columns under Fraser and Burgoyne had reached
the proper positions. Then, all three columns were to begin advancing
toward the American camp until a strong position could be found close
enough to it to serve as a base for further operations.</p>
<p>American scouts from the east side of the Hudson detected the forward
movement of Riedesel&rsquo;s column along the river road. When Gates
was first advised by his scouts of the British advance, he determined to
await their attack behind his breastwork. Arnold, however, insisted that
the issue should be fought in the field. He reasoned that the forest would
not only handicap the British from the standpoint of coordinated attack
and the full use of their artillery, but it would also offer a screen peculiarly
adaptable to the American style of fighting. If defeated in the field,
he argued, the troops could then fall back to their entrenchments.</p>
<p>Finally yielding to Arnold&rsquo;s wish, Gates ordered out Morgan&rsquo;s riflemen,
supported by Dearborn&rsquo;s light infantry, to reconnoiter the position
of the enemy. Moving northward along the road from Fort Neilson,
Morgan divided his forces in an effort to locate the enemy. The first
phase of the engagement opened about 12:30 in the afternoon when a
detachment of Morgan&rsquo;s men brushed with the advance guard of Burgoyne&rsquo;s
center column in a clearing known as Freeman&rsquo;s Farm. The first
volley all but wiped out the British picket. Rushing forward in hot pursuit
of the few survivors, the detachment ran head-on into the main body
of Burgoyne&rsquo;s center column only to be driven back in turn and widely
scattered. By persistent use of his turkey call signal, however, Morgan
was able to rally his men and prepare for the second phase of the engagement.
Aided by the arrival of the regiments of Colonels Cilley
and Scammel from Poor&rsquo;s brigade, he re-formed his line in the woods
along the southern edge of the 15-acre clearing.</p>
<p>Forming his line along the northern edge of the Freeman clearing,
Burgoyne advanced to the attack with the 21st regiment on the right,
the 62nd in the center, and the 20th on the left. Morgan&rsquo;s men suddenly
poured such a withering fire into the solidly advancing columns that
the British line wavered and fell back across the clearing. Following
closely, the Americans were again driven back, as the British quickly
rallied their lines.</p>
<p>For more than 3 hours the fighting swayed back and forth across the
bitterly contested clearing as each side strove desperately for a decision.
Repeatedly the hard-pressed British regiments charged with the bayonet,
only to be stopped short by the deadly fire of the American riflemen.
Under the skillful direction of Arnold, American reinforcements were
so placed as to threaten seriously to outflank the British right. Finally,
when the British position had become critical, Riedesel arrived with
fresh reinforcements. Throwing his men with great force against the
American right, he succeeded in steadying the British line and forcing
the Americans to withdraw gradually. But for the arrival of Riedesel,
the fate of the Burgoyne campaign might well have been decided here.
Approximately 4,000 Americans participated in this fight, while about
5,000 more were held inactive by Gates behind the fortified lines. The
attacking American force was opposed through most of the day by the
1,800 British soldiers that composed Burgoyne&rsquo;s center column. It was
almost dusk before Fraser&rsquo;s 2,800 men and the 550 German troops under
General Riedesel came to Burgoyne&rsquo;s aid.</p>

<p>The first battle was thus fought under the &ldquo;fog of war.&rdquo; Because of
the great forest which shielded each army from the other, neither Burgoyne
nor Gates was sure of the other&rsquo;s dispositions or intentions.
General Burgoyne believed that the main American attack was directed
against his right and thus held Fraser with the elite troops in reserve.
General Gates, on the other hand, was of the opinion that the main
British attack was directed against the American right along the river
road and therefore held back the 5,000 American troops to defend this
key pass. For this reason, the battling columns were reinforced only in
a piecemeal fashion by both generals until late in the day. The contestants
were thus evenly matched until dusk when Burgoyne finally ordered
in regiments from both flanking columns and drove the Americans from
the field of battle. The heavy, unknown forest and darkness, however,
prevented any effective pursuit.</p>
<p>Stopped in his advance about 1 mile north of the American lines with
a badly crippled army, but left in possession of the immediate field of
battle, Burgoyne decided to entrench his troops in the vicinity of the
Freeman Farm. There he awaited the cooperation of Howe or Sir Henry
Clinton, who was then stationed in New York. He also felt the need of
reconnoitering the American position as he still knew virtually nothing
about it.</p>

<p>Confident and self-assured as a result of their first encounter, the American
troops grew restive as they impatiently awaited a further attack.
Despite drenching rains, chill nights, inadequate supplies, and scanty
rations, these ragged troops, who held the destiny of a nation in their
hands, could still find heart to make merry at night. So exuberant was
their revelry, in fact, that the sentries complained that because of the
noise they could not hear the British and would find it impossible to
warn their comrades if they did. In order to correct this condition, Gates
had to issue an early curfew order.</p>

<p>Nearly 3 weeks of futile waiting brought Burgoyne no aid from either
Howe or Clinton. On October 6, however, unknown to Burgoyne,
Clinton did succeed in capturing the forts along the highlands of the
Hudson (he reached as far north as Esopus [Kingston] on October 16).
With the strength of his opponent greatly increased by the arrival of
4,000 militia reinforcements so that he was outnumbered now two to
one, and, with his supplies rapidly diminishing, Burgoyne&rsquo;s position
became a desperate one, necessitating either an advance or a retreat.
After some hesitation, he decided to risk everything on a second battle.</p>

</div>
<p>Accordingly, on the morning of October 7, Burgoyne ordered a reconnaissance
in force to determine the nature of the ground and the
advisability of a thrust at the American left. With 1,500 picked men,
led by Generals Fraser, Riedesel, and Phillips, and supported by two
12-pounders, six 6-pounders, and two howitzers, Burgoyne moved out
from camp about 12 o&rsquo;clock and advanced toward the American left.
After moving in a southwesterly direction for a distance of approximately
two-thirds of a mile, the troops deployed in an open clearing where some
of them foraged in a wheat field.</p>
<p>Extending his line for more than 1,000 yards to the west, Burgoyne
occupied the southern slope of the rise of ground just north of the Middle
Ravine. On the right, under the Earl of Balcarres, was stationed the
British Light Infantry and the British 24th regiment, both under the
command of General Fraser. In the center was Riedesel with his German
contingent and batteries of two 12-pounders and two 6-pounders
under Major Williams and Captain Pausch. On the left was stationed
Major Acland in command of the British Grenadiers with the greater
portion of the artillery. Though the larger part of Burgoyne&rsquo;s front was
open, both his flanks rested in woods and were thus exposed to a surprise
attack. Investigating the news of the British advance, James Wilkinson,
Adjutant General to Gates, found their position favorable to
<span class="pb" id="Page_22">22</span>
attack and so reported to headquarters, whereupon Gates replied: &ldquo;Order
on Morgan to begin the game.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The American plan of attack was simple and direct. As Morgan undertook
a flanking movement against the Light Infantry on the British right
in that portion of the field farthest removed from the river, Poor was to
move against the Grenadiers on the British left. Once these two movements
had developed, Learned was to strike the German contingent
which made up the British center. The American attack opened about
2:30 in the afternoon with Poor&rsquo;s savage assault upon the British left.
Outnumbered two to one, the Grenadiers crumpled under the withering
fire of the Americans. By this time Morgan had struck the British right.
The British Light Infantry was driven back in confusion, and the right
flank and rear of the troops led by Balcarres were now seriously
threatened.</p>
<p>At this critical stage, General Fraser rode back and forth among his
men in a desperate effort to encourage them to make a stand and cover
the developing British retreat. In spite of all that he could do, his
troops continued to withdraw under the deadly fire of Morgan&rsquo;s corps.
In the confusion of attack and retreat, General Fraser was shot, perhaps
by a member of a party detailed for that purpose by Colonel
Morgan. Mortally wounded, he was carried from the field.</p>
<p>Before the enemy&rsquo;s flanks could be rallied, Arnold dashed impetuously
onto the field and led Learned&rsquo;s brigade in an attack against the Germans,
who comprised Burgoyne&rsquo;s center. Although without command
because of a quarrel with Gates after the battle of September 19,
Arnold now threw himself into the battle. By his powerful personality
and reckless daring he inspired the troops to redoubled effort. Though
the Germans repulsed the first attack, they were soon driven into retreat,
for the withdrawal of Fraser&rsquo;s troops and the British Grenadiers
had exposed them on both flanks.</p>
<p>When the 2,000-strong Albany County militia, commanded by Brig.
Gen. Abraham Ten Broeck, came up to join the fighting, the British
forces, discouraged by the loss of Fraser and the turn of events, retreated
to the protection of their fortified positions. Within less than
an hour after the opening of the attack, Burgoyne had lost 8 cannon
and more than 400 officers and men, killed, wounded, or prisoners.
Flushed with victory, part of the American forces were led by Arnold
in a savage and costly attack on the Balcarres Redoubt, a position of
great strength which lay on the Freeman Farm.</p>

<div class="pb" id="Page_24">24</div>
<p>When repeated attacks failed to carry this position, into which the
remnants of Burgoyne&rsquo;s flanking column had retreated, Arnold wheeled
his horse and, dashing between the crossfire from both armies, rode
northward in the direction of the Breymann Redoubt. In front of this
work were American units that had circled farther to the north after
the retreat of the British flanking column and had taken no part in the
attack on the Balcarres Redoubt. Between the Balcarres and Breymann
Redoubts stood two log cabins, held by Canadian troops. The attack
on Breymann&rsquo;s position was being delayed until these cabins could be
overcome. At about the time that Arnold arrived at the Breymann Redoubt,
an attack was launched against the front and left of the fortification.
Arnold joined the men attacking the left and rear. The combined
attacks rapidly drove the defending German troops from the
redoubt. Only darkness saved Burgoyne from a general retreat. As
Arnold entered the rear of the redoubt, just as the work fell, he was shot
in the leg by a German soldier. Had he died there, posterity would
have known few names brighter than that of Benedict Arnold. The fall
of this redoubt, which covered the right and rear of Burgoyne&rsquo;s fortified
camp, forced him to order a general retreat. Colonel Breymann
was killed in the assault on the redoubt that bears his name.</p>
<p>That night Burgoyne withdrew his army to the high ground north of
the Great Ravine. Fraser&rsquo;s life slowly ebbed away throughout the night,
and on the evening of October 8 he was buried in the Great Redoubt,
in accordance with his own request. The retreat of the army northward
was held up by Burgoyne long enough to administer the last rites in an
impressive ceremony as Fraser&rsquo;s body was lowered into the ground.
Shots from American gunners, who did not understand what was taking
place, struck close and threw dust on the officiating chaplain. Early in
the morning of October 9, the British Army took up its retreat to
Saratoga. The British had suffered approximately 1,000 casualties in the
fighting of the past 3 weeks as compared to an American loss of less
than half that number.</p>
<h2 id="c10"><span class="small"><i>Retreat and Surrender</i></span></h2>
<p>An American force was already present on the east side of the Hudson,
opposite Saratoga, thus blocking the crossing of the river. To continue
the retreat northward in an effort to reach Fort Edward was now almost
impossible for Burgoyne&rsquo;s weary and badly depleted army. In a few days
he was completely surrounded on the heights of Saratoga by the
American force which, by this time, had grown to about 20,000 men.
Hopelessly outnumbered, provisions all but exhausted, and devoid of
hope of help from the south, Burgoyne was forced to surrender on
October 17, 1777.</p>

<p>The remnants of Burgoyne&rsquo;s army, probably numbering about 5,800
men, stacked their arms on the level flood plains along the banks of the
Hudson near the ruins of Old Fort Hardy and became prisoners of war,
according to the terms of the Convention of Saratoga drawn up between
Gates and Burgoyne. By the terms of surrender, they were to be taken to
Boston where they would board vessels to return to England. It was provided
that they would not serve again in North America during the
Revolutionary War. Burgoyne, by inducing Gates to sign this convention,
almost succeeded in nullifying the great American victory at
Saratoga. If the terms of the convention had been carried out, Burgoyne&rsquo;s
army would have been available for service in Europe against the French,
whom the Americans were at this time desperately endeavoring to induce
to enter the war on the American side; or Burgoyne&rsquo;s army could have
been used to relieve for service in America an equal number of British
troops then garrisoning posts in other parts of the Empire, thus largely
repairing, within 6 months&rsquo; time, the damage to the British armies in
North America. The Continental Congress therefore interposed first one
obstacle and then another, and the terms of the convention were never
kept. The captured soldiers were held in the North for about a year, and
then most of them were sent to Charlottesville, Va., for the duration of
the war. The majority of these prisoners remained in this country after
the close of the war and were gradually absorbed among the populace
of the new nation. Many American families today can trace their origin
back to the British and German soldiers who surrendered at Saratoga.</p>
<p>The failure of the Burgoyne expedition, so auspiciously launched, may
be attributed to a series of blunders and misfortunes climaxed by the
heroic defense of a despised adversary. In his failure specifically to order
Howe to cooperate with Burgoyne, the British Colonial Secretary, Lord
George Germain, in the very beginning laid the basis for the campaign&rsquo;s
fatal ending. Through carelessness, this order, though prepared, was
apparently never mailed and was allowed to remain tucked away in a
pigeonhole. To this costly blunder was added the refusal of Howe to
cooperate in the northern expedition, despite the fact that he had been
informed by Burgoyne and others of the expected nature of his participation.
When advised by Howe of his proposed expedition against
Philadelphia, Germain approved the plan but expressed the hope that
it would be completed in time for cooperation with Burgoyne.</p>
<p>In persisting in the Philadelphia expedition against the advice of
Clinton and other British officers who advised cooperation with
Burgoyne, Howe preferred a plan of campaign which gained the British
nothing to a plan which might well have won them the war. In his
defense later, Howe argued that he had received no order to cooperate
with the northern army; that he had warned Burgoyne not to expect aid
from the south; that his move to Philadelphia had been approved by
the King; and finally that he had advised Clinton to assist Burgoyne.
This move of Clinton&rsquo;s however, came so late, and with such limited
force, as to make it ineffective.</p>

<p>As if this were not enough, Burgoyne&rsquo;s position was still further
weakened by the inability of St. Leger to create a proper diversion along
the Mohawk. These blunders and misfortunes, inherently grave as they
were, do not absolve Burgoyne altogether from responsibility for the
failure of the northern campaign. His conduct of the campaign, at times,
lacked forceful initiative and drive, to which were added grave errors of
judgment, the most serious of which, in all probability, was the poorly
planned expedition against Bennington. The imperative orders given to
Burgoyne by British ministers in England, with little leeway to adjust
his plans according to the actual course of events, was another important
cause of the complete failure of the campaign. Sir Guy Carleton, then
Governor of Canada, wrote in 1777: &ldquo;This unfortunate event, it is to be
hoped, will in the future prevent ministers from pretending to direct
operations of war, in a country at three thousand miles distance, of
which they have so little knowledge as not to be able to distinguish between
good, bad, or interested advices, or to give positive orders in
matters, which from their nature, are ever upon the change; so that
expedience or propriety of a measure at one moment, may be totally
inexpedient or improper in the next.&rdquo;</p>

</div>
<p>In no small sense, however, the success of the American cause may be
attributed to the skill of the colonial infantry who, under the daring
leadership of Arnold and Morgan, had proved themselves more than a
match for the British veterans. Furthermore, the American ability to increase
their numbers within a short period of time materially added to
their ultimate success. The speed with which the county and State
governments called up the militia levies and forwarded the needed
supplies enhanced the American position; so that as Burgoyne&rsquo;s manpower
and supply situation became increasingly desperate, Gates&rsquo; became
stronger. Although most of the fighting at Saratoga was done
by Continental troops, corresponding to what we would call regulars
the presence of the militia made possible the commitment to the battles
of the better trained and organized Continentals.</p>

<p>The river bluffs on which American
batteries were emplaced dictated the tactics of both armies and the
course of the two battles of Saratoga. The American line was anchored
on these bluffs, because here the high ground converged with the river
to allow only a narrow corridor along the river plain. The road south
to Albany ran through this corridor. Both battles were fought as a result
of the British attempt to flank the American positions controlling
this passageway. This terrain factor must be appreciated if the course
of events at Saratoga is to be understood.</p>

<h3 id="c13">SITE OF FORT NEILSON.</h3>
<p>Situated on the crest of Bemis Heights at the
apex of the American line, stood Fort Neilson. In reality the fort was a
fortified barn, named for John Neilson, the farmer who owned it.
Strengthened on either side by heavy batteries and protected by a breastwork
of logs and felled trees, the fort constituted a key point in the
American line. The overlook from this point offers a sweeping panorama
of exceptional beauty and charm. From here are visible the Adirondacks,
the Green Mountains in Vermont, the Berkshires in Massachusetts, and
the Catskills.</p>
<p>Now standing on the site of Fort Neilson is the Block House, containing
relics of the Revolutionary period and exhibits designed to
present the story of the Battles of Saratoga and the Burgoyne Campaign.</p>
<h3 id="c14">THE NEILSON HOUSE.</h3>
<p>Located within the fortified area of Fort Neilson,
the Neilson House is the only contemporary building still standing on
the battlefield. This house, the home of John Neilson, served as the
quarters of Generals Benedict Arnold and Enoch Poor. From this building
Poor went to lead his troops in gallant action on both September 19
and October 7. It was to this building that Major Acland, of the British
Grenadiers, was brought severely wounded on October 7; and it was also
to this building that Lady Acland, in defiance of great hardships, came
to nurse her wounded husband. The smoked walls, planked floors, and
rough period furniture preserve much of the Revolutionary atmosphere.</p>

<p>On the little plateau east and below the

Stevens, Major Commandant of Artillery, entitled, &ldquo;Return of Ordnance
and Stores in Camp near Stillwater, September 24, 1777,&rdquo; with a subheading,
&ldquo;Stores in Magazine,&rdquo; it has been possible to determine the
exact character and quantity of the supplies located within the magazine.</p>
<h3 id="c16">FREEMAN&rsquo;S FARM.</h3>
<p>No part of the battlefield witnessed heavier fighting
than the area known as Freeman&rsquo;s Farm. Around this farmhouse and its
oblong clearing of 15 acres, the swirling tides of battle beat relentlessly
in the engagements of both September 19 and October 7. The original
Freeman farmhouse, owned at the time of the battles by Isaac Leggett,
occupied approximately the site of the present building by that name.
Following the battle of September 19, it was included within the fortification
known as the Balcarres Redoubt. The oblong clearing ran east
and west across the same small ridge on which the Freeman house stood.</p>

<h3 id="c17">BALCARRES REDOUBT.</h3>
<p>Situated on the same ridge as the Freeman farmhouse,
the Balcarres Redoubt extended approximately 500 yards in a
north-south direction. The redoubt was an enclosed work mounting
eight cannon, with walls from 12 to 14 feet in height and constructed
of logs with earth thrown over them. The front of this work was covered
with a strong abatis built of felled trees. The Balcarres Redoubt
thus constituted the strongest fortification of the British line. Under
the command of the Earl of Balcarres, the fortification was erected shortly
after the Battle of September 19 and was occupied by the British Light
Infantry. In fierce attacks, the American forces, on October 7, repeatedly
<span class="pb" id="Page_34">34</span>
assailed this redoubt in vain. Arnold&rsquo;s successful assault on the Breymann
Redoubt, however, finally served to outflank the position and
force its evacuation.</p>

<p class="pcap"><i>This shaft was erected in 1931 by the Daughters of the
American Revolution of New York State as a memorial to
the American soldiers who died at Saratoga.</i></p>
</div>
<h3 id="c18">BREYMANN REDOUBT.</h3>
<p>The Breymann Redoubt was situated on the extreme
right flank of the British line and was erected to defend the right
flank of the Balcarres Redoubt and to cover a road that ran from this
point to the American camp. The Breymann Redoubt thus served as
the key to the entire British position. The redoubt was constructed and
defended by German troops, under command of Lieutenant Colonel
Breymann, shortly after the battle of September 19. It consisted of a
single line of breastworks, approximately 200 yards in length, with short
flank defenses and no works in the rear. On the right, on high ground,
it mounted a battery of two cannon that was captured by the Americans
on October 7. The ground before the redoubt was cleared and there was
no abatis before this work. The walls of the redoubt were constructed
of logs and rails. The logs were laid horizontally one upon the other and
were supported between upright pickets, or posts, driven into the ground
on either side of the wall and fastened together at the top. The breastwork
was between 7 and 8 feet in height, with an opening of about 9 or
10 inches wide, at a suitable height for small arms. It was here in the
closing hours of October 7 that Arnold took part in the dramatic assault
that sealed the fate of the Burgoyne Campaign. The unique
monument to Arnold&rsquo;s wounded leg is located on the site of the
Breymann Redoubt.</p>
<h3 id="c19">FIRST LINE OF BATTLE, OCTOBER 7.</h3>
<p>Situated approximately three-fourths
of a mile northwest of the site of Fort Neilson and extending some 1,000
yards west of present State Route 32, is the position which the flanking
column of 1,500 soldiers under Burgoyne occupied at the beginning
of the American attack on October 7. Here on the southern slope of
the rise of ground, just north of the Middle Ravine, the British met
<span class="pb" id="Page_35">35</span>
the full fury of the first American attack. It was in this area that General
Fraser received his mortal wound and many other British officers
were killed, wounded, or taken prisoner before Burgoyne ordered a
retreat to the Balcarres Redoubt. The badly wounded Major Acland,
commander of the British Grenadiers, and Major Williams, commander
of the British Artillery, were both taken prisoners by the Americans
in this area on October 7.</p>

<p class="pcap"><i>The Schuyler House. The main part of this building was
erected by Gen. Philip Schuyler to replace an earlier house,
which was burned by Burgoyne&rsquo;s troops on October 10, 1777.
The house, situated in Schuylerville (Old Saratoga), is being
restored to the period of Schuyler family occupancy.</i></p>
</div>
<h3 id="c20">THE GEN. PHILIP SCHUYLER PROPERTY.</h3>
<p>Situated at Schuylerville (Old
Saratoga), N.Y., this estate was the summer residence of Gen. Philip
Schuyler both before and after the Battles of Saratoga. The present
house was erected in 1777 by General Schuyler shortly after the surrender
of Burgoyne&rsquo;s army. It stands near the site of his former home,
which was burned by Burgoyne. Restoration to the period of occupancy
by the Schuyler family is under way, with further studies yet to be
completed. The structure is a 2-story frame house, 60 feet long by 21
feet wide. The walls are filled in with brick. There are seven spacious
rooms on the first floor and, in addition, a large kitchen. On the second
floor there are seven bedrooms in the main part of the house and
four more over the kitchen. Gen. John Stark, George Washington,
Governor Clinton, and Alexander Hamilton were guests of the Schuylers
in this house.</p>
<h2 id="c21"><span class="small"><i>How To Reach the Park</i></span></h2>
<p>The park is on the upper Hudson River, 28 miles north of Albany,
N.Y., between the villages of Stillwater and Schuylerville, and may be
reached by automobile from the north or south over State Route 32,
connecting with U.S. 4 at Bemis Heights and Schuylerville. From the
west, convenient connections with U.S. 9 may be made over State
Routes 9P and 423. Taxi service is available from Mechanicville,
Schuylerville, and Saratoga Springs.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_36">36</div>
<h2 id="c22"><span class="small"><i>About Your Visit</i></span></h2>
<p>The park and its facilities are open from early spring until late autumn,
depending upon weather conditions&mdash;normally from April 1
to November 30.</p>
<p>A museum, containing relics of the Revolutionary Period and exhibits
designed to present the story of the Battles of Saratoga and the
Burgoyne Campaign, is open daily, Sundays and holidays included,
from 8:30 a.m. to 5 p.m. Park literature is available in the museum.
The John Neilson House, used as quarters for American staff officers
during the battles, is also usually open to visitors. Informational signs
and markers along the park roads will assist you to visualize events
connected with the battles.</p>
<p>Special service, without charge, is provided for school classes, civic
groups, and organizations when arrangements are made in advance
through the park administration.</p>
<h2 id="c23"><span class="small"><i>Administration</i></span></h2>
<p>In 1938, Congress authorized the establishment of Saratoga National
Historical Park. In 1941, under this authority, 1,429 acres of historically
important land, previously acquired by the State of New York, were
accepted by the Federal Government for administration and protection
as a National Historical Park Project. Later, other historically significant
parts of the battlefield were acquired, and the establishment of
the park was accomplished on June 22, 1948. The present area is almost
4 square miles.</p>
<p>Saratoga National Historical Park is administered by the National
Park Service, U.S. Department of the Interior. Communications regarding
the park should be addressed to the Superintendent, Saratoga National
Historical Park, R.F.D. No. 1, Stillwater, N.Y.</p>

Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
